Project description:
For the final DWA project, the goal is to build a podcast app allowing users to browse various podcast shows, play episodes,
and track their favourite episodes.
Also neededto meet 50 user stories.


Technology used:
I  used a framework called  React  to built this project because it manages the complixity of the code and its very much user friendly
and easy to code and understand.
