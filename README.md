Podcast App

Project description:
For the final DWA project, the goal is to build a podcast app allowing users to browse various podcast shows, play episodes,
and track their favourite episodes.
In this podcast App i needed to meet 50 user stories.


Technology used:
I  used a framework called  React  to built this project because it manages the complixity of the code and its very much user friendly
and easy to code and understand.
Styling: I used CSS  .

Features
Browse Podcast Shows: Users can explore a catalog of podcast shows with detailed information about each show, such as title, description, and cover image.
Play Episodes: Users can listen to podcast episodes directly on the app with a built-in audio player.
Track Favorites: Users can mark episodes as favorites, and the app will provide a way to access and manage their favorite episodes.
Search Functionality: Implement a search feature that allows users to search for specific podcast shows or episodes\Data
 

Data consists of three basic semantic units:

EPISODE: Corresponds to a specific MP3 file that a user can listen to
SEASON: A collection of EPISODE released across a specific timespan
SHOW: A specific podcast that contains a single or several SEASON
